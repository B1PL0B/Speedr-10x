## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. Install a user script manager extension for your browser:
   - [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/) (recommended)
   - [Greasemonkey](https://www.greasespot.net/) (Firefox)
   - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/)

### Installing the Script

1. Click the "Install" button on this page or copy the script code
2. Your user script manager will prompt you to install the script
3. Click "Install" or "OK" to confirm

Alternatively, you can manually create a new script in your user script manager and paste the code.

## Usage

Once installed, you'll see a small "10x Speed: OFF" button in the top-right corner of any webpage.

- **Click the button** to toggle between normal speed and 10x speed
- **Keyboard shortcut**: Press `Alt+X` to toggle speed modes

When enabled, the button will turn green and show "10x Speed: ON".

## How It Works

The script hooks into the browser's timer functions (`setTimeout`, `setInterval`) and the `Date` object to modify the page's perceived passage of time. It also automatically detects and speeds up HTML5 video elements.

## Dependencies

This script requires the [Everything-Hook](https://greasyfork.org/scripts/372672-everything-hook) library (automatically included).
